# Automatic measurement of Newton rings diameter
This is semesteral thesis for course  called analysis of biomedical images. The images are from school microscope and are deteriorated by heavy noise. Some of this noise comes from environment of measurement, but the images are mostly deteriorated by working incorrectly with microscope or by dirtying the lenses and glass with hands.
The example of provided image is below.

On the images we can see concentric circumferences under different light. The theory tells that by calculating the radius of circumferences, we can get the wavelength of used light. For more theory, you can read this article in wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_rings.

Goal of this project is to determine in the most precise way the exact radius. This task is quite difficult due to heavy noise.
